## 🔧 Requirements

Make sure you have:
- Python 3.x
- A VirusTotal API key (set as an environment variable `VT_API_KEY`)
- Required dependencies:
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## 🎮 How to Use

### 1. Set Up API Key
- Get your API key from [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)

    ```
  - **Linux/macOS**:
    ```sh
    export VT_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    ```

### 2. Create a `.env` File (Alternative Method)
If you prefer using an `.env` file, create one in the project directory and add:
```
VT_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### 3. Run the Program
```sh
python script.py
```

### 4. Upload a CSV File
- Make sure it has a `Remote Host` or `Address` column with domain names.
- Select the file using the GUI.

### 5. Start Scanning
